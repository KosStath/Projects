# TV Series Database

Welcome to the TV Series Database project! 

This folder contains the database schema and associated scripts for managing a TV series database created using SQL and Oracle.

## Contents

This folder includes the following files:

### SQL Scripts

1. **Create.sql**: 
   - Contains the SQL commands to create the database schema, including tables and relationships.

2. **Constraints.sql**: 
   - Defines the constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to ensure data integrity.

3. **Insert.sql**: 
   - Provides SQL commands for inserting sample data into the database tables.

4. **Query.sql**: 
   - Includes various SQL queries to retrieve information from the database, demonstrating how to extract meaningful data.

5. **Drop.sql**: 
   - Contains SQL commands to drop tables and remove the database schema, useful for cleanup or resetting the database.

### ER Diagram

- **TVSeries_ERD.drawio**: 
  - This file contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the TV Series database, created using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, including entities, relationships, and attributes.

### Documentation

- **Table Specifications.docx**: 
  - A Word document detailing the specifications of each table in the database, including descriptions of the columns, data types, and relationships. This document helps to understand the structure and purpose of each table in the schema.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Execute the `Create.sql` script to create the database schema.
   - Run the `Constraints.sql` script to apply constraints and ensure data integrity.

2. **Populate the Database**:
   - Use the `Insert.sql` script to insert sample data into the tables.

3. **Query the Database**:
   - Use the `Query.sql` script to run predefined queries and explore the data.

4. **Clean Up**:
   - If needed, execute the `Drop.sql` script to drop tables and remove the schema.

5. **Review the ERD**:
   - Open `TVSeries_ERD.drawio` in draw.io to view the Entity-Relationship Diagram for a visual representation of the database structure.

6. **Consult the Table Specifications**:
   - Review the `Table Specifications.docx` document for detailed information about each table and its columns.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Oracle SQL tools installed for executing the SQL scripts.
   - Install [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or use its web version to view the ERD.

2. **Execution**:
   - Open the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL editor or command line tool and execute them in the provided order.

3. **Viewing the ERD**:
   - Use draw.io to open and view the `TVSeries_ERD.drawio` file.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Open the `Table Specifications.docx` in Microsoft Word or a compatible word processor.
